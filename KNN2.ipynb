    "The choice of distance metric can significantly impact performance. Euclidean distance is common when features are on a similar scale, and the relationship between them is linear. Manhattan distance may be preferred when features have different scales or when the relationships are better captured by a piecewise linear path. The choice depends on the characteristics of the data."

    "Common hyperparameters include k (number of neighbors), the distance metric, and sometimes the weights assigned to neighbors. The choice of k affects model sensitivity, while the distance metric influences how the algorithm measures similarity. Tuning can be done through techniques like grid search or random search, evaluating performance metrics for different combinations of hyperparameters."

    "A larger training set generally improves the model's ability to generalize. However, an excessively large dataset may lead to increased computation time.

    "Drawbacks include sensitivity to irrelevant features, high computation cost for large datasets, and susceptibility to outliers. Overcoming these may involve feature selection or dimensionality reduction to address irrelevant features, using approximate nearest neighbors methods for large datasets, and employing robust distance metrics or outlier detection techniques to handle outliers. Additionally, proper scaling of features can mitigate sensitivity to irrelevant features."
