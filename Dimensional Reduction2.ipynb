    "A projection in PCA (Principal Component Analysis) refers to the transformation of data points onto a lower-dimensional subspace defined by the principal components. It is used to represent the data in a reduced space while retaining as much variance as possible. The principal components are orthogonal vectors that capture the directions of maximum variance in the original data."

    "The optimization problem in PCA aims to find the principal components that maximize the variance of the projected data. Mathematically, PCA seeks to maximize the variance of the projected data points along the principal components. The first principal component corresponds to the direction of maximum variance, and subsequent components capture the remaining orthogonal directions of maximum variance."

    "The choice of the number of principal components impacts the trade-off between dimensionality reduction and information retention. Selecting too few principal components may result in loss of information, while choosing too many may include noise and overfit the model.

    "PCA handles data with varying variances across dimensions by identifying principal components that capture the directions of maximum variance. It effectively prioritizes dimensions with high variance, making them dominant in the reduced feature space.
