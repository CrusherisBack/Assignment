    "The \"curse of dimensionality\" refers to the challenges and issues that arise as the number of features or dimensions in a dataset increases. It becomes more difficult to analyze and model data in high-dimensional spaces due to the exponential growth of the space and the sparsity of data points. Dimensionality reduction is important in machine learning to mitigate these challenges, improve model performance, and enhance interpretability."

    "The curse of dimensionality contributes to overfitting by allowing models to fit noise rather than true patterns in the data. In high-dimensional spaces, models have more capacity to memorize the training data, which may not generalize well to unseen data. On the other hand, underfitting may occur if the model cannot capture the complexity of the high-dimensional data."
