    "**Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors:**\n",
    "- **Eigenvalues:** Eigenvalues are scalar values that represent the scaling factors of the eigenvectors in a linear transformation. For a square matrix A, the eigenvalues (λ) satisfy the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0, where I is the identity matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Eigenvectors:** Eigenvectors are non-zero vectors that, when multiplied by a matrix, only change in scale (by the corresponding eigenvalue). For a square matrix A and an eigenvalue λ, the eigenvector v satisfies the equation Av = λv.\n",

    "**Eigen-Decomposition Approach:**\n",
    "Eigen-Decomposition is a technique that decomposes a square matrix A into a product of its eigenvectors and eigenvalues. Mathematically, if a matrix A can be written as \\(A = PDP^{-1}\\), where P is the matrix of eigenvectors and D is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues, then this is an eigen-decomposition of A.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "Consider a 2x2 matrix A:\n",
    "\\[ A = \\begin{bmatrix} 4 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 3 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n",

    "\\[ \\text{det}\\left(\\begin{bmatrix} 4-\\lambda & 1 \\\\ 2 & 3-\\lambda \\end{bmatrix}\\right) = 0 \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving this equation gives two eigenvalues: λ₁ = 5 and λ₂ = 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each eigenvalue, we find the corresponding eigenvector(s) by solving (A - λI)v = 0:\n",
    "- For λ₁ = 5, solving \\(A - 5I)v = 0\\) gives the eigenvector v₁ = \\(\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix}\\).\n",
    "- For λ₂ = 2, solving \\(A - 2I)v = 0\\) gives the eigenvector v₂ = \\(\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix}\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the matrix A can be decomposed as:\n",
    "\\[ A = PDP^{-1} \\]\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\\[ P = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & -1 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n",
    "\\[ D = \\begin{bmatrix} 5 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, P is the matrix of eigenvectors, and D is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues. The decomposition expresses A as a linear combination of its eigenvectors and eigenvalues."
