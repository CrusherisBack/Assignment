    "a) run(): This method is called when a thread is started using the start() method. It defines the code that the thread will execute. You should override this method in a subclass of Thread and define your thread's code in it.\n",

    "c) join(): This method waits for the thread to finish. It blocks the calling thread until the thread being joined completes execution. You can also specify a timeout argument, which will cause the join operation to return after a certain amount of time, even if the thread being joined hasn't finished yet.\n",

    "A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release resources, so none of them can proceed. This situation can arise when a thread holds a resource (such as a lock) and needs another resource held by another thread to proceed, while that thread needs the resource held by the first thread to proceed. This results in a circular dependency where neither thread can release its resource, leading to a deadlock.\n",
    "\n",
    "A race condition, on the other hand, occurs when the behavior of a program depends on the relative timing of events that are not under the program's control. In other words, the outcome of the program depends on which thread gets to execute a particular section of code first. This can lead to unpredictable and inconsistent behavior of the program, making it difficult to debug and maintain."
